This could be because of an issue with the checkpoint, or because your version of Transformers is out of date.\n\nYou can update Transformers with the command `pip install --upgrade transformers`. If this does not work, and the checkpoint is very new, then there may not be a release version that supports this model yet. In this case, you can get the most up-to-date code by installing Transformers from source with the command `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git`"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# =======================================\n","# STEP 3: Run Inference (Fundus Image + Question)\n","# =======================================\n","\n","# Sample fundus image (replace with your dataset)\n","url = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Fundus_photograph_of_normal_left_eye.jpg\"\n","image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw).convert(\"RGB\")\n","\n","question = \"Does this fundus image show signs of diabetic retinopathy?\"\n","\n","inputs = processor(images=image, text=question, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device, torch.float16)\n","\n","# Generate answer\n","output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64)\n","answer = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","\n","print(\"Question:\", question)\n","print(\"Answer:\", answer)"],"metadata":{"id":"yhn7Z7GBgpFF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# =======================================\n","# STEP 4: LoRA Fine-tuning Scaffold\n","# (You can extend this with your own dataset)\n","# =======================================\n","\n","# Configure LoRA for lightweight fine-tuning\n","lora_config = LoraConfig(\n","    r=8,\n","    lora_alpha=16,\n","    target_modules=[\"q_proj\",\"v_proj\"],  # typical for LLaVA-style adapters\n","    lora_dropout=0.05,\n","    bias=\"none\",\n","    task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\"\n",")\n","\n","# Wrap model with LoRA adapters\n","model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)\n","\n","# Dummy dataset (replace with real fundus+QA pairs)\n","from datasets import Dataset\n","data = {\n","    \"image\": [url],\n","    \"question\": [\"What is the diabetic retinopathy grade?\"],\n","    \"answer\": [\"No DR\"]\n","}\n","dataset = Dataset.from_dict(data)\n","\n","print(\"Dataset ready:\", dataset)\n","\n","# Training loop placeholder (to be extended)\n","# Use Hugging Face Trainer or Accelerate for full fine-tuning"],"metadata":{"id":"V-RS8ep8g0qA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
